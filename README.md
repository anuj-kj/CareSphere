# CareSphere Sample Application

## Overview
CareSphere is a sample solution built using a layered architecture to ensure separation of concerns, scalability, and maintainability. This document provides an overview of the tech stack, project structure, and design patterns used in the solution.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core
- **Frontend**: React
- **Database**: SQL Server
- **Authentication**: OAuth2, JWT, Credential-based Authentication
- **Unit Testing**: xUnit, Moq
- **Dependency Injection**: Built-in ASP.NET Core DI
- **ORM**: Entity Framework Core

## Project Structure
The solution is divided into several projects, each representing a different layer of the application:

1. **Domain Layer**
   - Contains the core business logic and domain entities.
   - Implements domain services and business rules.
   - Uses domain-driven design principles.

2. **Data Layer**
   - Responsible for data access and persistence.
   - Implements the Repository and Unit of Work patterns.
   - Uses Entity Framework Core for ORM.

3. **Service Layer**
   - Contains application services that orchestrate business logic.
   - Acts as an intermediary between the API layer and the domain layer.
   - Implements service interfaces and their concrete implementations.

4. **API Layer**
   - Exposes RESTful endpoints for the frontend to interact with.
   - Implements controllers and API endpoints.
   - Handles authentication and authorization using OAuth2, JWT, and credential-based authentication.

5. **UI Layer**
   - Built with React to provide a responsive and interactive user interface.
   - Communicates with the API layer to fetch and display data.
   - Implements OAuth2 authentication flow.

6. **Unit Test Layer**
   - Contains unit tests for the domain, data, and service layers.
   - Uses xUnit for testing framework and Moq for mocking dependencies.
   - Ensures code quality and correctness through automated tests.

## Design Patterns
The solution leverages several design patterns to ensure a clean and maintainable codebase:

1. **Repository Pattern**
   - Abstracts data access logic and provides a clean API for data operations.
   - Encapsulates the logic for querying and persisting data.

2. **Unit of Work Pattern**
   - Manages transactions and ensures that multiple operations are executed within a single transaction.
   - Coordinates the work of multiple repositories.

3. **Dependency Injection**
   - Uses ASP.NET Core's built-in DI container to manage dependencies.
   - Promotes loose coupling and enhances testability.

4. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**
   - Focuses on the core domain and domain logic.
   - Uses entities, value objects, and aggregates to model the domain.

5. **Service Layer Pattern**
   - Encapsulates business logic and coordinates tasks between different layers.
   - Provides a clear separation between the API layer and the domain layer.

6. **Factory Pattern**
   - Used to create instances of complex objects.
   - Encapsulates the object creation logic.

## Authentication and Authorization
- **OAuth2**: Used for user authentication and authorization.
- **JWT**: Used to secure API endpoints and manage user sessions.
- **Credential-based Authentication**: Allows users to authenticate using username and password.

## Conclusion
CareSphere is designed with a focus on scalability, maintainability, and separation of concerns. By leveraging a layered architecture and various design patterns, the solution ensures a clean and robust codebase that can be easily extended and maintained.
