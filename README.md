# CareSphere Sample Application

## Overview
CareSphere is a sample solution built using a layered architecture to ensure separation of concerns, scalability, and maintainability. This document provides an overview of the tech stack, project structure, and design patterns used in the solution.
Added sample Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles for Orders

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core
- **Frontend**: React
- **Database**: SQL Server
- **Authentication**: OAuth2, JWT, Credential-based Authentication
- **Unit Testing**: xUnit, Moq
- **Dependency Injection**: Built-in ASP.NET Core DI
- **ORM**: Entity Framework Core


## Domain-Driven Design (DDD) for Orders

### Key Concepts

1. **Entities**: Objects that have a distinct identity that runs through time and different states. For example, an `Order` entity.
2. **Value Objects**: Objects that describe some characteristics or attributes but have no conceptual identity. For example, `OrderItem`.
3. **Aggregates**: A cluster of domain objects that can be treated as a single unit. For example, an `Order` aggregate might include `OrderItems`.
4. **Repositories**: Mechanisms for encapsulating storage, retrieval, and search behavior which emulates a collection of objects.
5. **Domain Events**: Events that are significant to the domain and are used to communicate between different parts of the system.

### Order Domain Implementation

#### Entities

- **Order**: Represents a customer's order.
- **OrderItem**: Represents an item within an order.

#### Value Objects

- **OrderStatus**: Represents the status of an order (e.g., Pending, Shipped, Delivered).

#### Aggregates

- **OrderAggregate**: The root aggregate that includes `Order` and its `OrderItems`.

#### Repositories

- **IOrderRepository**: Interface for order repository.
- **OrderRepository**: Implementation of the order repository.
#### Services

- **IOrderService**: Interface for order service.
- **OrderService**: Implementation of the order service.
#### Domain Events

- **OrderStatusChangedEvent**: Event triggered when the status of an order changes.
- **OrderItemAddedEvent**: Event triggered when an item is added to an order.

#### Event Handlers

- **OrderEventHandlers**: Handles domain events related to orders.




## Project Structure
The solution is divided into several projects, each representing a different layer of the application:

1. **Domain Layer**
   - Contains the core business logic and domain entities.
   - Implements domain services and business rules.
   - Uses domain-driven design principles.

2. **Data Layer**
   - Responsible for data access and persistence.
   - Implements the Repository and Unit of Work patterns.
   - Uses Entity Framework Core for ORM.

3. **Service Layer**
   - Contains application services that orchestrate business logic.
   - Acts as an intermediary between the API layer and the domain layer.
   - Implements service interfaces and their concrete implementations.

4. **API Layer**
   - Exposes RESTful endpoints for the frontend to interact with.
   - Implements controllers and API endpoints.
   - Handles authentication and authorization using OAuth2, JWT, and credential-based authentication.

5. **UI Layer**
   - Built with React to provide a responsive and interactive user interface.
   - Communicates with the API layer to fetch and display data.
   - Implements OAuth2 authentication flow.

6. **Unit Test Layer**
   - Contains unit tests for the domain, data, and service layers.
   - Uses xUnit for testing framework and Moq for mocking dependencies.
   - Ensures code quality and correctness through automated tests.

## Design Patterns
The solution leverages several design patterns to ensure a clean and maintainable codebase:

1. **Repository Pattern**
   - Abstracts data access logic and provides a clean API for data operations.
   - Encapsulates the logic for querying and persisting data.

2. **Unit of Work Pattern**
   - Manages transactions and ensures that multiple operations are executed within a single transaction.
   - Coordinates the work of multiple repositories.

3. **Dependency Injection**
   - Uses ASP.NET Core's built-in DI container to manage dependencies.
   - Promotes loose coupling and enhances testability.

4. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**
   - Focuses on the core domain and domain logic.
   - Uses entities, value objects, and aggregates to model the domain.

5. **Service Layer Pattern**
   - Encapsulates business logic and coordinates tasks between different layers.
   - Provides a clear separation between the API layer and the domain layer.

6. **Factory Pattern**
   - Used to create instances of complex objects.
   - Encapsulates the object creation logic.

## Authentication and Authorization
- **OAuth2**: Used for user authentication and authorization.
- **JWT**: Used to secure API endpoints and manage user sessions.
- **Credential-based Authentication**: Allows users to authenticate using username and password.

## Conclusion
CareSphere is designed with a focus on scalability, maintainability, and separation of concerns. By leveraging a layered architecture and various design patterns, the solution ensures a clean and robust codebase that can be easily extended and maintained.
